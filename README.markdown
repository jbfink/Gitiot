##Gitiot - The one-click git commit GUI.

Gitiot is a really simple cross-platform GUI wrapper for the most minimal useful subset of git's awesome power; i.e. one-button commit and push-to-master for people who want revision control but don't want to learn the command line.

Stay tuned - more to come soon.

###Notes

I expect to use git-python http://gitorious.org/git-python
